# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. The core idea of KNN is based on the principle that data points with similar features tend to belong to the same class or category.

Here's how KNN works:

1. Determine the number of neighbors (k): The first step is to choose the number of nearest neighbors that will be considered for making the prediction. This is a user-defined parameter, and the value of k affects the accuracy and complexity of the model.

2. Calculate distance: For a given test point, the algorithm calculates the distance between this point and all the other data points in the training dataset. The distance can be measured using various metrics, such as Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, or Minkowski distance.

3. Find the k nearest neighbors: The k data points with the shortest distances to the test point are identified as the nearest neighbors.

4. Voting or averaging: For classification tasks, the algorithm takes a majority vote among the k nearest neighbors to predict the class of the test point. In the case of regression tasks, the average of the target values of the k nearest neighbors is used as the prediction.

KNN is a lazy learner, meaning it doesn't build an explicit model during the training phase; instead, it stores the entire training dataset in memory. The algorithm only performs calculations during the prediction phase, which can make it computationally expensive, particularly with large datasets.

Some key advantages of KNN include its simplicity, its ability to handle multi-class problems, and its robustness to noisy data. However, KNN can suffer from high computational cost, sensitivity to the choice of k and distance metric, and a potential lack of interpretability.
